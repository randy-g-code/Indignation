# Indignation - An action RPG developed in Unity.

Inspired by Dark Souls by From Software.
Indignation was an attempt at recreating some of their popular mechanics with our own twists in mind.

**Unfortunately we have ceased development and have decided to move on to other projects.**

## List of Features we Managed to Implement:
- Blocking & Parrying
- Enemy AI
- Rolling
- Camera Systems
- UI
- Rage Mode*
- Character Stats
- Health Items
- Lock On

>*Rage mode was a high-risk secondary form designed for both player and enemy once health dropped below a certain threshold.
Intended to give the player not only a second chance but a whole other playstyle to work around.
